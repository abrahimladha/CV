\emph{Armstrong Research Summer 2014 - Spring 2015, Spring 2016}\\
Worked under Dr. Brown on the N-Queens Problem as a combinatorics researcher as part of the STEP Summer program. The research continued for the 2014-2015 year allowing me to write a paper, and attend several conferences and events to present my work. I begin research with Dr. Lambert on Topological Graph Theory later this semester (Spring 2016).\\

\section*{PREPRINTS}

Exploring mod-2 $n$-queens games (submitted for publication)\\
We introduce a two player game on an $n \times n$ chessboard where queens are placed by alternating turns on a chessboard square whose availability is determined by the number of queens already on the board which can attack that square modulo two. The game is explored along with some variations and its complexity.
